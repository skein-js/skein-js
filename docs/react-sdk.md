# React SDK / `useStream` compatibility

A core promise of skein-js: **your existing frontend code keeps working by changing only the
API URL.** That includes the React streaming hook, which is the most common way LangGraph
apps render agent output.

## The clients skein-js must satisfy

| Client           | Package                          | How it talks to skein-js                                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vanilla JS SDK   | `@langchain/langgraph-sdk`       | `client.threads.*`, `client.runs.stream()`, `client.runs.wait()` |
| **React hook**   | `@langchain/langgraph-sdk/react` | **`useStream({ apiUrl, assistantId })`** over SSE                |
| Agent Chat UI    | (built on `useStream`)           | Same SSE path                                                    |
| LangGraph Studio | —                                | Agent Protocol HTTP                                              |

## `useStream` against skein-js

```tsx
"use client";
import { useStream } from "@langchain/langgraph-sdk/react";

export function Chat() {
  const thread = useStream({
    apiUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SKEIN_URL!, // e.g. http://localhost:2024
    assistantId: "agent", // a graph id from langgraph.json
  });

  return (
    <div>
      {thread.messages.map((m) => (
        <div key={m.id}>{typeof m.content === "string" ? m.content : ""}</div>
      ))}
      <button onClick={() => thread.submit({ messages: [{ type: "human", content: "hello" }] })}>
        Send
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The only difference from a LangGraph Platform setup is that `apiUrl` points at a skein-js
server. `useStream` opens an SSE connection to `/runs/stream` (or the thread stream) and
renders `messages` / `values` / `custom` events as they arrive — exactly the frames skein-js
produces (see [streaming.md](./streaming.md)).

## Why it works over SSE

`useStream` is an SSE client. Because skein-js serves the Agent Protocol streaming endpoints as
`text/event-stream` with the same event names and payloads LangGraph emits, the hook cannot
tell the difference. **No WebSocket is required**, so deferring WebSocket transport in v1
does not affect the React SDK.

## Verification harness

[`examples/react-usestream`](../examples/react-usestream) is a minimal Next.js app wired to
`useStream` and pointed at a placeholder skein-js URL. Once the server lands, it is the
front-end signal that the SSE wiring satisfies the React SDK — token-by-token streaming in
a real browser. See [roadmap.md](./roadmap.md#verification).
