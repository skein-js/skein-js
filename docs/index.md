# skein-js — Overview

skein-js is a framework-agnostic TypeScript library that implements LangChain's
[**Agent Protocol**](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agent-protocol) on top of
[**LangGraph.js**](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraphjs), and ships a CLI that is a
**drop-in replacement for the LangGraph CLI**.

## The problem

You've built an agent as a LangGraph.js graph. On its own, a graph is a function you call
in-process. To put it behind a chat UI or expose it to other services you need a **server** — and a
capable agent server is a lot of plumbing:

- **Threads** — conversations that persist, with full state and history.
- **Runs** — execute the graph and either wait for the result, **stream** it, or run it in the
  background.
- **Streaming** — push tokens, tool calls, and reasoning to the client as they happen, with
  reconnect/replay if a connection drops.
- **Human-in-the-loop** — pause a run for approval and resume it later.
- **Long-term memory** — storage that outlives a single conversation.
- **Auth, CORS, persistence, and scaling** — the production essentials.

There is no first-class, **self-hostable** way to get all of this for LangGraph.js in the Node
ecosystem:

- **LangGraph Platform** (now **LangSmith Deployment**) is a **paid product**. You _can_ self-host
  it, but production self-hosting is an **Enterprise add-on requiring a commercial license key** —
  the platform's server runtime is source-available under the
  [Elastic License 2.0](https://www.elastic.co/licensing/elastic-license), not open source. The
  managed **Plus** plan is **$39 / seat / month** plus usage-based deployment pricing (~$0.005 per
  deployment run and per-minute uptime); fully self-hosted / hybrid is **Enterprise-only** with
  custom pricing. A free **Self-Hosted Lite** exists but is node-capped and still needs a LangSmith
  API key. ([pricing](https://www.langchain.com/pricing) ·
  [self-hosting docs](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph-platform/self-hosted), as of July 2026.)
- **[aegra](https://github.com/aegra/aegra)** — the leading _open_ self-hosted alternative — is
  **Python / FastAPI only**.

TypeScript teams are left to adopt the paid platform, run a Python sidecar, or hand-roll an HTTP
layer around a compiled graph.

## What is the Agent Protocol?

The [**Agent Protocol**](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agent-protocol) is the open HTTP + SSE
standard that describes an agent server's surface — assistants, threads, runs, streaming,
interrupts, and a store. Because it's a standard, the entire LangChain client ecosystem speaks it:

- [`@langchain/langgraph-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/langgraph-sdk) — the vanilla
  JS client (`client.threads` / `client.runs` / …)
- [`@langchain/langgraph-sdk/react`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/) — the **`useStream`**
  hook, streaming over SSE
- [Agent Chat UI](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agent-chat-ui) and LangGraph Studio

Implement the Agent Protocol and **all of these clients work with your server** — no custom SDK, no
bespoke wire format. skein-js implements it; your existing clients keep working with only a URL
change. See [agent-protocol.md](./agent-protocol.md) for the exact endpoints.

## The solution

skein-js is "aegra for TypeScript." It exposes the Agent Protocol wire format from any Node
HTTP framework (Express, Fastify, NestJS, and Next.js adapters ship today), so the whole LangChain
client surface keeps working with only a URL change.

Unlike aegra — which had to reimplement the server in Python because the Python
`langgraph-api` is proprietary — the **JavaScript Agent Protocol server is open source and
MIT** ([`@langchain/langgraph-api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/langgraph-api)).
So skein-js is deliberately thin: it **reuses as much LangGraph OSS as possible** (runtime,
checkpointers, parser, schemas, SDK/types) and rebuilds only the durable-production,
multi-framework, drop-in-CLI layer that OSS lacks. See [reuse.md](./reuse.md).

> **Guiding principles:** [Reuse first](./reuse.md) · [Simple, readable, functional code](./code-practices.md).

## The drop-in promise

The headline developer experience is **zero-effort migration off the LangGraph CLI**:

```diff
- "dev": "langgraph dev",
+ "dev": "skein dev",
```

…while keeping the existing [`langgraph.json`](./langgraph-cli-compat.md) unchanged. Both
the backend (config + graphs) and the frontend ([`useStream`](./react-sdk.md)) point at
skein-js by changing only a URL.

### The other on-ramp: embed a graph you already have

Never used the LangGraph CLI or Platform? There's nothing to migrate _from_ — but you can still get the
same server. If you already have a compiled graph in your own app, bring it **in code** — no
`langgraph.json`, no CLI:

```ts
import { createExpressServer } from "@skein-js/express";
import { createInMemoryDeps } from "@skein-js/server-kit";
import { graph } from "./my-graph.js";

const server = await createExpressServer({ deps: createInMemoryDeps({ agent: graph }) });
await server.listen(2024);
```

`createInMemoryDeps` assembles a `ProtocolDeps` (store, queue, bus, checkpointer) around your graphs;
`{ deps }` is the seam every adapter accepts. The two on-ramps produce the identical Agent Protocol
server — see [embedding.md](./embedding.md).

```

- **`@skein-js/core`** is the shared contract — wire types plus the `SkeinStore`, queue, and bus
  interfaces every other package depends on.
- **`@skein-js/agent-protocol`** holds the protocol logic once, against _normalized_ request/response
  types, driven entirely by injected dependencies. Framework adapters are thin shims, and the
  package is publishable on its own. See each doc below for detail.
